      <title>Data Science Capstone: Breast Cancer Prediction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my capstone project for the HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate. It demonstrates competency in R programming, statstical modeling and basic machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to train a machine learning classifier to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancer) or benign (not cancer) based on cell nucleus features extracted from digitized images of breast biopsy slides. It makes use of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set&lt;/a&gt;, a classic machine learning benchmarking dataset. Results and implications are analyzed from the perspective of a cancer biologist.&lt;/p&gt;
