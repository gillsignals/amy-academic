- I currently live in Cambridge, MA with my husband Stephen Rosen and our three cats, Geddy, Neil and Alex.
- I am originally from the Chicago suburbs, where my family still lives.
- My first word was "why" - an excellent start for a scientist!
- I have the coolest birthday - 6/7/89 at 10am.

## Personal interests

### Hiking and nature

Stunning landscapes bring me a sense of wonder and peace. Stephen and I love exploring nature, and our favorite way to do so is through day hikes. Although my disability requires me to move slowly and carefully with physical supports, that challenge enhances my joy and sense of accomplishment when I summit a mountain or complete a trail. We hope to travel widely and experience more natural wonders across the world.

I also live vicariously through nature documentaries and am immensely grateful to the [BBC Earth](https://www.bbcearth.com/) team for helping me experiences places I may never have the fortune of visiting. I hope that we as a species can preserve these majestic places and stabilize or reverse our environmental impacts that threaten the future of the planet.

Some of my favorite hiking locations (so far):

- [Acadia National Park](https://www.nps.gov/acad/index.htm)
- [Glacier National Park](https://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm)
- [Arches National Park](https://www.nps.gov/arch/index.htm)
- [Bryce Canyon National Park](https://www.nps.gov/brca/index.htm)
- [Geirangerfjord, Norway](https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/fjord-norway/the-geirangerfjord/)

### Canning

Together, Stephen and I enjoy making jam, jelly and fruit butter from fresh-picked fruit. We hope that our family and friends think our products are as delicious as we do! Some of our past products include black raspberry jam, apple butter, blueberry jam, currant jelly, pear butter and mixed berry preserves.

### Hockey

Stephen and I are avid hockey fans, especially of the Chicago Blackhawks (though we follow the whole league). One of our goals is to visit every NHL hockey stadium.
