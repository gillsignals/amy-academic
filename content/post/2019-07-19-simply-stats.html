<h2>Simply Statistics post</h2>
<p>I had the pleasure of writing a guest post on the <a href="https://simplystatistics.org/2019/07/19/more-datasets-for-teaching-data-science-the-expanded-dslabs-package/">Simply Statistics</a> blog today!</p>
<p>The post announces an update of the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dslabs/index.html"><strong>dslabs</strong> R package</a> in collaboration with Rafael Irizarry, which adds 7 new datasets on climate change, astronomy, life expectancy, and breast cancer diagnosis. The new datasets complement a significant update to the <a href="https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science">HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate Program</a>, where I wrote dozens of new problems to teach data science to new programmers through real-world case studies.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re interested in how the post was made, feel free to explore the <a href="https://github.com/gillsignals/science-docs/blob/master/simply-stats/more-datasets-simplystatistics.Rmd">R markdown version on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to <a href="http://rafalab.github.io/">Rafael Irizarry</a> for the opportunity to contribute to his data science educational materials and blog!</p>
