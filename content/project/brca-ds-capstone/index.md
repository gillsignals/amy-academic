This was my capstone project for the [HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science). It demonstrates competency in R programming, statstical modeling and basic machine learning.

The goal of this study was to train a machine learning classifier to predict whether a breast tumor is malignant (cancer) or benign (not cancer) based on cell nucleus features extracted from digitized images of breast biopsy slides. It makes use of the [Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic)), a classic machine learning benchmarking dataset. Results and implications are analyzed from the perspective of a cancer biologist.
