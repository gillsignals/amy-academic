> “Your profession is not what brings your weekly paycheck, your profession is what you’re put here on earth to do, with such passion and intensity that it becomes spiritual in calling.” - Vincent Van Gogh

Biomedical science is my profession. I am a biologist, teacher and data scientist training for a career in biomedical informatics and quantitative biology. In my current position, I develop content for the [HarvardX Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science) and [HarvardX Genomics Data Analysis XSeries](https://www.edx.org/xseries/genomics-data-analysis) on edX.

I currently seek a doctoral program to enhance my bioinformatics skills, practice teaching and perform patient-centered research. My primary passions are cancer systems biology and quantitative biology education. My career objectives are to teach quantitative biology skills to current and aspiring researchers while contributing to research that advances patient care.

Learn more about my motivation for science, research interests, teaching, diversity and personal background by exploring my site or reading my CV.
